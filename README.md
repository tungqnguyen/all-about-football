# All About Football

Usually, it isn't easy to find a match highlight that is up to date without having to try different videos on Youtube that sometimes are irrelevant and clickbait. All About Football is created to help football lovers to catch all the latest highlights with ease without having to search from multiple resources. Every piece of football information from results, highlights to standings or fixtures are available through the website. The project is still ongoing with new features are waiting to be implemented.
